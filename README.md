Final conceptual design for Silvernsoftware.com [ NOT FINISHED ] This product was halted mid-way through design.   
 This concept was meant to be an update to the site located at (http://www.silvernsoftware.com/) To bring more of an idea of the company, while keeping the site as a simple frontpage with a contact button. 
The site uses "Foundation" [http://foundation.zurb.com/] to simplify it's responsiveness.

Evolution of site; 
  As I was receiving very little input on site design at first I just threw everything against the wall to see what stuck. [ Version 1 link:  ]
  From there, Input was given for various visual elements, and the changes were made. [ Version 2 link:  ]
  After this version, I was asked to pare the site down to bare essentials. [ Version 3 link:  ]
  Once the client was happy with the amount of content, and had chosen background. I tried to make it visually appealing. [ Version 4 link:  ]
  After that, I was still waiting for specific content. I didn't have much to go on, so I just started designing the site around three main ideas to sell.  1st is the most eye-catching, the biggest, and the center image. It's meant to grab your attention and hold you on the site long enough to let your eyes go from left to right.  2nd, then is the image on the left. Slightly smaller, it's where your eyes should go next. Here you want something attractive. Something to evolve the idea of the first image, without repeating. 3rd, The eyes would go to the right image and complete the set. Here you should put something comforting. Here is where I would highlight my techsupport, or perhaps my availability via social media. 
  I used the main elements of an RPG Party to hold the places of these images. Tank, DPS, and Healers.  Tanks get your attention, DPS does the damage, Healers keep everyone alive.
